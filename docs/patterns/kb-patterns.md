You can find some usefully patterns to design knowledge base fast and accurate in `kb/pattern`.
There are examples to formalize classes, relations, instances, answer rules, classification rules and structures to answer to new messages.

In the `gwf` subdirectory you can find examples in scg. You can load `gwf` files to the scg-editor, synchronize and get new answers online.

For example, here you need to replace identifiers `concept_your_message_class_name`, `concept_your_class_identifier`, `concept_phrase_about_your_theme`,
and `lr_message_about_your_class` to your actual nodes. Also, you can change any relations if you need.

In the `scs` subdirectory you can find the same examples in scs.

In the `science` subdirectory you can find examples about science in scg. If you build this files (add to `repo.path`) you will get answer to the message about science.
Use it as a concrete example.

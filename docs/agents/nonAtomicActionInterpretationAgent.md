# Non-atomic action interpretation agent

Is an agent that generates an action description in the knowlendge base based on the template received. If there are sets of arguments then it performs a role mapping before generation.

**Action class:**

`action_interpret_non_atomic_action`

**Parameters:**

1. `nonAtomicActionTemplateAddr` containing a description of a non-atomic action;
2. **(optional)** `argumentsSet` -- action argument set.

**Comment:**

* If there is no need for a `set of arguments`, then an empty `set of arguments` or no set is allowed;
* The transition to the next action depends on the result of the previous one.

**Workflow:**

* The first argument of the non-atomic action is replaced by the node that belongs to the set of arguments as the first, the second argument of the non-atomic action is replaced by the node belongs to the set as the second;
* In the course of an agent's work, the `template` program generates a description of a non-atomic action. The atomic actions composing it are also added to the class of performed (successfully or unsuccessfully) by the agents that performed them.
